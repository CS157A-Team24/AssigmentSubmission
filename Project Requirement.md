## Project Overview

#### Overview:
The goal of this application is to create social news, rating site, and discussion website. Users can be able to check daily news, search, filter, and sort through posts. Also, users can create posts, comment on them, like, and share posts. In addition, users can create channels that will function as communities. Users can view posts without logging in, but creating posts, commenting, and liking will require the user to login. This application will allow people to easily voice their opinion or share a story. People can easily ask questions and others can answer them. It will also provide a user-friendly interface and fast response time while maintaining high throughput. 

#### Who would be interested in this application?
Users could be anyone who is interested in forming a community online, and interact with people with similar interests. Users can keep up to date with news, information, and ideas in their community. Companies and organizations can use Seenit to communicate with people and market products.
