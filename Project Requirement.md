## Project Overview
+The goal of this application is to create social news, rating site, and discussion website. Users can be able to check daily news, search, filter, and sort through posts. Also, users can create posts, comment on them, like, and share posts. In addition, users can create channels that will function as communities. Users can view posts without logging in, but creating posts, commenting, and liking will require the user to login. This application will also provide a user-friendly interface and fast response time while maintaining high throughput.
